## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
2. Git is a version control system, and GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating with other developers. Git can be used without GitHub, but GitHub relies on Git for version control.
3. A branch will allow us to work on something that is not on the main branch. 
4. The purpose of a pull request is to facilitate collaboration and code review among team members or contributors.
5. git checkout -b 
6. git fetch downloads changes from a remote repository to a local repository, git merge integrates changes from one branch into another, and git pull combines the two by fetching changes and automatically merging them into the current branch.
7. A merge conflict on GitHub occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from two different branches. 
8. By reviewing the conflicting changes and deciding which ones to keep, or modifying the changes to combine them in a way that makes sense.
